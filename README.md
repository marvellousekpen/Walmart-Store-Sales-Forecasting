# Walmart-Store-Sales-Forecasting
## INTRODUCTION
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate sales performance and identify various factors that influence it.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Walmartâ€™s Sales Strategy Manager needs clear insights into sales trends but struggles with complex reports and limited BI support. He aims to identify patterns, measure markdown effectiveness, and understand holiday sales impact to drive better decisions. Using SQL, this analysis will uncover key metrics:

-  Sales trends over time
-  Four-week moving average  
-  Percentage change in sales  
-  Sales breakdown by type  
-  Impact of markdowns, especially during holidays  
-  Performance distribution across store types  


### DATA SOURCE
The data is sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gustavoserafim/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting-gsr">Kaggle</a>

### SKILLS/CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

- **Data Import & Integration:** Imported multiple CSV files into SQL using Python.  
- **SQL Querying & Optimization:** Utilized JOINS, CTEs, subqueries, and functions for in-depth analysis.  
- **Data Aggregation & Trend Analysis:** Applied aggregation techniques to uncover sales trends and performance insights.

### VALIDATION - CALCULATING THE POTENTIAL ROI
For this analysis, I included a breakdown of the calculations used to evaluate sales performance. Using SQL, I analyzed key metrics to assess the impact of markdowns and sales trends across Walmart stores.

This breakdown includes:

Calculating the 4-week moving average to smooth out sales trends over time.
Determining percentage change in sales to track growth or decline.
Analyzing markdown effectiveness by comparing sales before and after markdowns.
Evaluating holiday sales impact by comparing holiday vs. non-holiday sales.
Assessing performance distribution across store types to identify top-performing stores.
These calculations provide actionable insights into sales trends, markdown strategies, and store performance, helping optimize revenue and pricing strategies.
